# Final Project Summary: AI-Powered CRC Molecular Subtype Analysis

This project provides a complete, end-to-end system for classifying colorectal cancer (CRC) molecular subtypes from histopathology images, based on the research by Pitroda et al. (2018), JAMA Oncology.

The final system includes a reproducible training pipeline and a comprehensive, user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time analysis.

---

## ðŸš€ Quickstart: Running the Final Application

The primary application is `molecular_analysis_app.py`. It is fully self-contained and provides the main user interface for image analysis.

1.  **Ensure all dependencies are installed:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run molecular_analysis_app.py
    ```

    The application will launch in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Application Features:
-   **ðŸ”¬ Live Analysis:** Upload H&E stained images for real-time classification.
-   **ðŸ“Š In-Depth Report:** View detailed analysis, including confidence charts and clinical context.
-   **ðŸ“¥ Downloadable Reports:** Save the analysis as a Markdown file.
-   **ðŸ§¬ Model & Performance:** Get transparent details on the AI model.
-   **ðŸ“š Clinical Guide:** A quick reference for the molecular subtypes.

## ðŸ§  Training the Model

The model was trained on synthetic data to recognize the key morphological patterns of the three molecular subtypes. You can reproduce the training process using the `train_final_model.py` script.

1.  **Run the training script:**
    ```bash
    python train_final_model.py
    ```

    This script will:
    a.  Generate 1,000 synthetic images in the `data/synthetic_patterns/` directory.
    b.  Train the `EfficientNet-B1` model.
    c.  Monitor validation loss and use early stopping to prevent overfitting.
    d.  Save the best-performing model to `models/final_crc_subtype_model.pth`.

## ðŸ“‚ Final Project Structure

The project has been cleaned up to leave only the essential, final files:

-   `molecular_analysis_app.py`: The main, self-contained Streamlit application.
-   `train_final_model.py`: The reproducible training script.
-   `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.
-   `models/`: Directory where the trained model is stored.
-   `data/`: Directory where synthetic training data is generated.
-   `FINAL_README.md`: This file, serving as the final project guide.

All previous application files (`app.py`, `app_clean.py`, `app_fixed.py`, etc.) have been removed to avoid confusion.
