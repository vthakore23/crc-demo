# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

Your app is now ready to deploy to Streamlit Cloud! Follow these steps:

### 1. Go to Streamlit Cloud
Visit: https://share.streamlit.io

### 2. Sign In
- Use your GitHub account to sign in
- Authorize Streamlit to access your repositories

### 3. Deploy New App
Click "New app" and fill in:
- **Repository**: `vthakore23/crc-demo`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Main file path**: `app.py`

### 4. Advanced Settings (Optional)
You may want to set:
- **Python version**: 3.8 or higher
- **Secrets**: If you have any API keys or sensitive data

### 5. Deploy
Click "Deploy" and wait for the build to complete (usually 5-10 minutes)

## 📋 Pre-deployment Checklist ✅

✅ All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
✅ `requirements.txt` is up to date
✅ `packages.txt` includes system dependencies
✅ Main app file is `app.py` in root directory
✅ Model files are handled (either included or downloaded on startup)

## 🔧 Deployment Configuration

Your app is configured with:
- **Foundation Model**: Multi-scale fusion with 4 scales
- **Molecular Subtyping**: Enhanced with all improvements
- **UI**: Professional medical-grade interface
- **Demo Mode**: Available for testing without uploads

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Model Files**: The balanced tissue classifier model needs to be available. The app handles this by:
   - Checking for local model files
   - Creating placeholder if missing
   - Showing appropriate messages

2. **Memory Usage**: The app uses PyTorch models which can be memory-intensive. Streamlit Cloud provides:
   - 1 GB RAM (free tier)
   - Consider optimizing if you hit limits

3. **GPU Support**: Streamlit Cloud doesn't provide GPU. The app automatically falls back to CPU.

## 🎯 Post-Deployment

Once deployed, your app will be available at:
```
https://crc-demo.streamlit.app
```

Share this URL with collaborators and stakeholders!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are in requirements.txt
3. Check for any hardcoded paths that need to be relative
4. Verify model files are handled correctly

## 📊 Latest Improvements Included

Your deployment includes all the recent enhancements:
- ✅ Vision Transformer & ConvNeXt support
- ✅ 4-scale fusion (including 0.125x)
- ✅ Mixup/CutMix augmentations
- ✅ Differential learning rates
- ✅ Semi-supervised learning
- ✅ Clinical metadata integration
- ✅ Pitroda classification ready

Happy deploying! 🎉
