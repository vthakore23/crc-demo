# Large Image Handling Improvements

## Overview
The CRC Analysis Platform has been enhanced to handle large medical images (including 80+ MB files) without crashing on Streamlit Cloud's limited resources.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. File Size Validation
- Added file size check during upload (max 200 MB)
- Clear error message if file exceeds limit

### 2. Memory-Efficient Image Processing
- Images larger than 4096x4096 pixels are automatically resized while maintaining aspect ratio
- Preview thumbnails are generated for display (max 800x800) to reduce memory usage
- Original resolution is preserved for analysis where possible

### 3. Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks around image processing
- Graceful error messages with detailed traceback in expandable sections
- Memory cleanup after processing using garbage collection

### 4. UI Improvements
- Shows file size, resolution, and megapixel count
- Warning for images over 20 megapixels
- Progress indication during resizing

### 5. Configuration Updates
- Updated Streamlit config for better memory management
- Added psutil dependency for potential memory monitoring
- Updated Pillow to latest version for better large image handling

## Technical Details

### Maximum Dimensions
- Preview display: 800x800 pixels
- Processing: 4096x4096 pixels (automatically resized if larger)

### Memory Management
- Explicit garbage collection after analysis
- Image objects deleted after processing
- Streamlit's file watcher disabled to reduce overhead

## Usage Tips

1. **For best performance**, pre-process images to reasonable sizes (under 4096x4096)
2. **WSI files** (.svs, .ndpi) are handled differently with tile-based processing
3. **Memory usage** scales with image resolution, not file size

## Future Improvements

- Progressive image loading for ultra-large images
- Tile-based processing for standard images (not just WSI)
- Memory usage monitoring and warnings
- Cloud-optimized image formats support
