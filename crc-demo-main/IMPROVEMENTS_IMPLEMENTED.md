## Usage for EPoC Cohort

The model is now ready to:
1. Receive EPoC cohort data with patient records and molecular subtypes
2. Extract patches from WSIs using the existing pipeline
3. Fine-tune the foundation model using the new molecular_subtype_finetuner
4. Predict subtypes (Canonical, Immune, Stromal) without sequencing

### Next Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
   ```python
   # Use prepare_epoc_molecular_training.py to process EPoC data
   # Ensure slide-level labels are mapped to Pitroda classification
   ```

2. **Fine-tuning**:
   ```python
   from foundation_model.pretraining.molecular_subtype_finetuner import MolecularSubtypeFinetuner
   
   # Load pre-trained foundation model
   foundation_model = load_pretrained_model()
   
   # Create fine-tuner
   finetuner = MolecularSubtypeFinetuner(
       foundation_model=foundation_model,
       config_path="foundation_model/configs/pretraining_config.yaml",
       device=torch.device('cuda')
   )
   
   # Train with clinical metadata
   finetuner.train(train_loader, val_loader, unlabeled_loader, class_weights)
   ```

3. **Deployment**:
   - Integrate the fine-tuned model into the Streamlit app
   - Add molecular subtype prediction tab
   - Include confidence scores and explainability maps

## Hardware Recommendations

As noted in the conversation:
- **Pre-training**: Requires GPU cluster (4× A100 or similar)
- **Fine-tuning**: Can be done on Mac M3 Pro with reduced batch size (8-16)
- **Inference**: Runs efficiently on Mac for demo/validation

## Conclusion

All major recommendations from ChatGPT have been implemented. The model architecture and training pipeline are now optimized for achieving state-of-the-art performance in CRC molecular subtype prediction from H&E images alone, potentially revolutionizing clinical practice by eliminating the need for routine sequencing.
