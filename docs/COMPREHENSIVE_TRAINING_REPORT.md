## 📈 Detailed Performance Analysis

### Metric Interpretations

#### Accuracy
**Definition:** Percentage of correctly classified samples out of total samples  
**Formula:** `(True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Samples`  
**Context:** Primary metric for overall model performance

**Performance Levels:**
- **90-100%:** Excellent - Production ready
- **80-90%:** Good - Acceptable for most applications
- **70-80%:** Fair - May need improvement
- **60-70%:** Poor - Requires significant improvement
- **<60%:** Unacceptable - Model needs retraining


#### Precision
**Definition:** Of all positive predictions, how many were actually correct  
**Formula:** `True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)`  
**Context:** Critical for medical applications where false positives are costly

**Performance Levels:**
- **90-100%:** Excellent - Very few false positives
- **80-90%:** Good - Acceptable false positive rate
- **70-80%:** Fair - Moderate false positives
- **<70%:** Poor - Too many false positives


#### Recall (Sensitivity)
**Definition:** Of all actual positive cases, how many were correctly identified  
**Formula:** `True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)`  
**Context:** Critical for medical screening where missing cases is dangerous

**Performance Levels:**
- **90-100%:** Excellent - Very few missed cases
- **80-90%:** Good - Acceptable miss rate
- **70-80%:** Fair - Some important cases missed
- **<70%:** Poor - Too many cases missed


#### F1-Score
**Definition:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall  
**Formula:** `2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`  
**Context:** Best single metric when you need balanced precision and recall

**Performance Levels:**
- **90-100%:** Excellent - Balanced high precision and recall
- **80-90%:** Good - Well-balanced performance
- **70-80%:** Fair - Some imbalance between precision/recall
- **<70%:** Poor - Significant precision/recall trade-offs


#### Validation Loss
**Definition:** Average loss on validation set (lower is better)  
**Formula:** `Cross-entropy loss for classification tasks`  
**Context:** Indicates model confidence and potential overfitting

**Performance Levels:**
- **<0.5:** Excellent - Model very confident in predictions
- **0.5-1.0:** Good - Reasonable confidence
- **1.0-2.0:** Fair - Moderate confidence
- **>2.0:** Poor - Low confidence, possible overfitting


### Current Model Performance Assessment

#### Overall Performance
- **Test Accuracy: 82.38%** - ✅ **GOOD** - Acceptable for clinical use
- **Validation Accuracy: 85.09%** - Model generalization indicator
- **Overfitting Check:** 2.71% gap - ✅ **EXCELLENT** - No overfitting
