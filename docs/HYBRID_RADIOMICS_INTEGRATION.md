# Hybrid PyRadiomics-Deep Learning Integration

## Overview

This integration combines handcrafted radiomic features with deep learning features to improve the accuracy and interpretability of molecular subtype prediction in colorectal cancer liver metastases. The hybrid approach addresses the limitations of using either approach alone by leveraging the complementary strengths of both methods.

## Key Features

### 1. **Dual Feature Extraction**

- **PyRadiomics Features**: Handcrafted features based on domain knowledge
  - First-order statistics (intensity histograms)
  - Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) - texture analysis
  - Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM) - texture patterns
  - Shape-based features - tumor morphology
  - Multi-scale analysis with LoG and Wavelet filters

- **Deep Learning Features**: Data-driven representations from ResNet50
  - Tissue composition probabilities
  - Spatial feature maps from intermediate layers
  - Learned representations optimized for classification

### 2. **Advanced Feature Selection**

- **Ensemble Selection**: Combines multiple feature selection methods
  - LASSO regression for sparse feature selection
  - Random Forest importance scoring
  - Statistical tests (f_classif)
  - Boruta algorithm (wrapper method)
- **Voting System**: Features selected by multiple methods are prioritized
- **Interpretability**: Feature importance scores for clinical understanding

### 3. **Robust Classification**

- **Ensemble Models**: Combines multiple classifiers
  - Random Forest (handles non-linear relationships)
  - XGBoost (gradient boosting for complex patterns)
  - Logistic Regression (linear baseline)
- **Cross-validation**: Ensures generalization performance
- **Probability Calibration**: Reliable confidence estimates

### 4. **Clinical Interpretability**

- **SHAP Explanations**: Feature contribution analysis
- **Feature Categories**: Organized by clinical relevance
  - Tumor morphology (shape features)
  - Tumor intensity (first-order features)
  - Tumor texture (GLCM, GLRLM features)
  - Spatial organization (deep learning features)
- **Clinical Reports**: Automated interpretation for pathologists
