- **CUDA:** 11.8+ or 12.0+
- **Python:** 3.11+
- **Job Scheduler:** SLURM 20.11+ (preferred)

## 🚀 **Quick Deployment Instructions**

### **Step 1: Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vthakore23/crc-demo.git
cd crc-demo
```

### **Step 2: Environment Setup**
```bash
# Load required modules
module load cuda/11.8 python/3.11 openmpi/4.1.4

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv epoc_env
source epoc_env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r deployment/cluster/requirements_cluster.txt
```

### **Step 3: Data Preparation**
```bash
# Create data directory structure
mkdir -p /data/epoc_molecular_data
mkdir -p /scratch/crc_molecular/checkpoints
mkdir -p /results/crc_molecular

# Copy your EPOC manifest file
cp your_epoc_manifest.csv /data/epoc_molecular_data/epoc_manifest.csv
```

### **Step 4: Configuration**
```bash
# Review and update configuration file
nano deployment/cluster/configs/epoc_config.yaml

# Key settings to verify:
# - data_path: /data/epoc_molecular_data
# - num_gpus: [adjust based on available hardware]
# - batch_size: [adjust based on GPU memory]
```

### **Step 5: Launch Training**
```bash
# Submit SLURM job
sbatch deployment/cluster/submit_training.sh

# Or run directly for testing
python deployment/cluster/epoc_trainer.py --config deployment/cluster/configs/epoc_config.yaml
```

### **Step 6: Monitor Progress**
```bash
# Check job status
squeue -u $USER

# Monitor training logs
tail -f logs/training_rank_0.log

# View TensorBoard (optional)
tensorboard --logdir=logs/tensorboard
```

## 📋 **Pre-Deployment Checklist**

- [ ] Backup strategy in place

**Software Dependencies:**
- [ ] All packages from requirements_cluster.txt installed
- [ ] PyTorch with CUDA support working
- [ ] Distributed training libraries (NCCL) available
- [ ] Monitoring tools configured (optional: Weights & Biases)

## 📊 **Expected Training Details**

**Training Configuration:**
- **Duration:** ~48 hours for full training
- **Resource Usage:** 4x GPUs, 128 total batch size
- **Checkpoints:** Saved every 5 epochs
- **Monitoring:** Real-time loss curves and accuracy metrics

- **Baseline Accuracy:** 33.33% (current EfficientNet-B1)
- **Enhanced Target:** 41-45% (+8-12% improvement)
- **Long-term Goal:** 96%+ accuracy with full roadmap

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**

**Common Issues & Solutions:**

1. **CUDA Out of Memory:**
   ```bash
   # Reduce batch size in config file
   sed -i 's/batch_size: 32/batch_size: 16/' deployment/cluster/configs/epoc_config.yaml
   ```

2. **Slow Data Loading:**
   ```bash
   # Increase number of workers and use faster storage
   export TMPDIR=/scratch/tmp
   ```

3. **SLURM Job Failures:**
   ```bash
   # Check detailed job information
   sacct -j $SLURM_JOB_ID --format=JobID,State,ExitCode,MaxRSS
   ```

4. **Network Communication Issues:**
   ```bash
   # Test distributed training setup
   python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 deployment/cluster/epoc_trainer.py --test
   ```
